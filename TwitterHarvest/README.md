# Deploy the Harvester



## You need

- zuom.key (private key)



## Steps

1. Add `zuom.key` to your ssh agent using `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" && ssh-add zuom.key`

2. run `deploy.sh`

   1. It will compress the TwitterHarvester, send it to all nodes and build the docker images on them.

3. IF youâ€™re deploying the harvester for the **first time**: run `deploy-run.sh`, meanwhile setting up the environment variable like this:

   1. ``````
      TH_DB=test1 TH_CITYNAME=Melbourne bash "deploy-run.sh"
      ``````



NOTE that the service will be named using the `TH_CITYNAME` environment variable, and two services CANNOT use the same name.

NOTE if you want to update your harvester, you first shutdown the harvest, then `deploy` and lastly `deploy-run`.



# Shutdown

You can use

``````
TH_CITYNAME=Melbourne bash shutdown.sh
``````

to shutdown (and remove) the harvester of Melbourne.

Since we are giving -re and -kw same city, then only one city name is required.
